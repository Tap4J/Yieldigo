    ```sh
    cd path/to/your/project
    ```
3. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:
      ```sh
      python3 -m venv env

**Run Jupyter Lab with the Notebook and Data**

To run the Jupyter Notebook with all the data in the GitHub repository, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you are still in the project directory.
2. Start Jupyter Lab:

    ```sh
    jupyter lab
    ```
3. A new tab will open in your default web browser, displaying the Jupyter Lab interface.
